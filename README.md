# receipt-processing-software


This is a receipt processor!

This was made with the MERN stack.

For those with npm, start server with node server.js on terminal in directory backend.

For those without npm installed, this will use a docker file in the future. Docker compose up on the root directory of this project should allow you to view on local host port 3000.
