# receipt-processing-software


This is a receipt processor!

This was made with the MERN stack.

If you wish to run this without docker:

1. Open up a terminal with directory in backend then use command node server.js.
2. Open up a terminal with directory in frontend then install npm using command npm install --legacy-peer-deps.
3. Note due to legacy features this may break in the future.
4. Afterwards, in the terminal with frontend, use command npm start.
5. This should opne up in localhost 3000.

For those without npm but have docker:
1. Get docker desktop.
2. Then open up terminal and make sure directory is in receipt-processing-software folder.
3. Then run docker-compose build.
4. Then run docker-compose up.
5. This should open up backend on port 4000, and frontend on local host 3000.

This may use another db in mongo. WORK IN PROGRESS!!!!
